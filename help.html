        <h2>Important Notice</h2>
        <p>Ninjaview Extension will not work without the Ninjaview Application for Windows. After purchasing a subscription plan. You will receive an email with further instructions. Sorry we do not support other operating systems at this time. </p>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>Welcome to NinjaView Autotrader. Before you commence, please ensure to download our application, a requisite step to establish communication with NinjaTrader. Features such as Auto-Trade and Manual Trade are reliant on this application and will remain non-functional without it.</p>
    
        <p>Upon opening the downloaded application, you will be furnished with a serial number intended for your activation key. This serial number must be submitted to NinjaView staff for verification. Upon successful verification, you will receive an activation serial number enabling access to the NinjaView Windows application.</p>
    </section>
        <section class="section">
<h2>Webhook</h2>
<p>To enable the Webhook feature, a subscription to our service is required. With this feature activated, the NinjaTrader extension utilizes <strong>ngrok</strong> to create a webhook. This process allows for external access to your local system, enabling the reception and processing of your TradingView alerts. Consequently, trades are automated directly to NinjaTrader, creating a streamlined trading experience.</p>

<h2>Auto Trade</h2>
<p>The Auto Trade feature also requires a subscription. Instead of using an external webhook, this feature sets up a <strong>local server</strong> dedicated to processing your TradingView alerts. This ensures a close-knit and consistent environment for trade automation to NinjaTrader. Please note, while our aim is for perfection, actual results may vary.</p>


    <section class="section">
        <h2>Manual Trade</h2>
        <p>The Manual Trade settings empower you to trade Ninja Trader accounts directly via a TradingView chart. However, please be informed that the Profit and Loss (PnL) display is exclusive to accounts supported by Tradovate.</p>
    
        <p>For the optimal functionality of PnL, it is mandatory to be logged into your Tradovate account in a separate tab. Subsequently, the "Manual Trade" window must be loaded onto both the Tradovate and TradingView charts to capture live PnL accurately. Once configured, you will have access to Live price, PnL, quantity, account, and the ticker of your choice to trade.</p>
    
        <p>It is crucial to select a ticker supported by NinjaTrader. For instance, if you are on NQ1! and the current date is August 1st, 2023, input "NQ 12-23" to trade the appropriate contract that is supported by Ninja Trader, rather than using NQ1!.</p>

        <h2>Test Alerts</h2>
        <p>Test Alerts serve as a crucial diagnostic tool to ensure that all settings are configured correctly. Utilizing the 'Manual Settings', namely Account, Ticker, and Quantity, you can execute 'Market Long', 'Market Short', and 'Market Close All' to verify the setup.</p>
    
        <p>Once the test executions run smoothly without any discrepancies, you can be assured that the system is ready for actual trading operations, providing you with reliability and peace of mind in your trading endeavors.</p>

        <h2>Gmail & TV Account</h2>
        <p>The integration of Gmail is essential for identity verification, while the TV Account ensures your TradingView account is impeccably synchronized with the NinjaView extension. Gmail is pivotal for a secure and personalized user experience, and the TV Account is crucial for seamless synchronization and functionality.</p>
    
        <p>If discrepancies are noted or synchronization seems improper, please navigate to TradingView and refresh the page. Successful verification and synchronization are indicated by the presence of check marks on Gmail, TV Account, and the extension, confirming that all systems are properly aligned and operational.</p>
